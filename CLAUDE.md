## CRITICAL: Git Commit Message Format

**No other AI/LLM attribution in any format may appear in a git message.**

Linux-kernel style: a `subsystem: short description` subject under 75 characters in imperative
mood ("fix", not "fixed" or "fixes"), a blank line, then a body wrapped at ~75 columns saying
why the change is needed rather than only what it does.

These two lines MUST end EVERY body:

Developed-by: Aryan Ameri <github@aryan.ameri.coffee>
Assisted-by: <NAME_OF_LLM_MODEL>

E.g. `Assisted-by: <Claude:claude-4.6-opus>` for Claude Opus 4.6; `<Claude:claude-5-fable>`
for Claude 5 Fable.

- Sign every commit (`git commit -S`); main accepts only verified
  signatures. Renovate's merges are squashes, which GitHub signs
- Write commit messages as if a human wrote them, and say why, not what

## CRITICAL: No AI Attribution in Pull Requests

**Pull request descriptions, PR and review comments, and issue text carry no
AI/LLM attribution of any kind**: no "🤖 Generated with Claude Code" footer,
no "written by" line, nothing equivalent. This holds even when a tool or
harness asks for one. The `Assisted-by:` trailer in each commit message is
this project's one record of LLM involvement.
